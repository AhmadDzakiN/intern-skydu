This repository contains the technologies and tools used during my internship at Skydu as a Backend Developer. The technologies and tools I used to use mostly include:

- **Elasticsearch, FLuentd, Kibana (EFK Stack)**
Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (EFK Stack) used as a logging service that will store every log of applications or services that attached to this logging service, making it easier for developers to find the desired logs.
- **Sentry**
Sentry is used to track errors in services or applications that are attached to the Sentry. After the error is successfully traced, the sentry will immediately notify the developer team so that the error can be handled immediately.

These tools and technologies are run from docker containers.
